Remember, an issue is not the place to ask questions. You can use  [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/harbor)  for that, or you may want to start a discussion in [Slack](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/CC1E09J6S).


Before opening a new issue, it is highly likely that someone else asked the same question before.
